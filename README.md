The **COMPAS** framework is an open-source, Python-based framework for computational research and collaboration in architecture, engineering and digital fabrication.

The main library consists of a core package (**compas**) and several additional
packages for integration of the core functionality in CAD software (currently: **compas_blender**, **compas_rhino**, **compas_ghpython**).

The core package defines all *real* functionality.
The CAD packages simply provide a unified framework for processing, visualising, and interacting with geometry and datastructures, and for building user interfaces in different CAD software.

## Getting Started

The recommended way to install **COMPAS** is to use [Anaconda/conda](https://conda.io/docs/):

```bash
conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda install COMPAS
```

But it can also be installed using `pip`:

```bash
pip install COMPAS
```

To verify your setup, start Python from the command line and run the following:

```python
>>> import compas
>>> import compas_rhino
>>> import compas_blender
>>> import compas_ghpython
```
