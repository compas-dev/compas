This folder contains larger sample files that are not included in the `pip` releases
to keep the distribution size small. Instead of being copied locally, they are intended
to be accessed via the raw user content server of Github.

The `compas.get()` function can be used to retrieve the path to them, just like other sample
files included in the source distribution.
