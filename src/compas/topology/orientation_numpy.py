def unify_cycles_numpy(vertices, faces, root=0):
    """Unify the cycle directions of the given faces such that adjacent faces share opposite halfedges.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vertices : sequence[[float, float, float] | :class:`~compas.geometry.Point`]
        A list of vertex coordinates.
    faces : sequence[sequence[int]]
        A list of faces with each face defined by a list of indices into the list of vertices.
    root : int, optional
        The starting face.

    Returns
    -------
    list[list[int]]
        A list of faces with the same orientation as the root face.

    Raises
    ------
    AssertionError
        If not all faces were visited.

    Notes
    -----
    The algorithm works by first building an adjacency dict of the faces, which can be traversed efficiently to unify all face cycles.
    Although this process technically only requires the connectivity information contained in the faces,
    the locations of the vertices can be used to speed up execution for very large collections of faces.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> vertices = [[0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 1.0, 0.0], [0.0, 1.0, 1.0]]
    >>> faces = [[0, 1, 2], [0, 3, 2]]
    >>> unify_cycles_numpy(vertices, faces)
    [[0, 1, 2], [2, 3, 0]]

    Parameters
    ----------
    xyz : sequence[[float, float, float] | :class:`~compas.geometry.Point`]
        The coordinates of the face vertices.
    faces : sequence[sequence[int]]
        A list of faces with each face defined by a list of indices into the list of xyz coordinates.

    Returns
    -------
    dict[int, list[int]]
        For every face a list of neighbouring faces.

    Notes
    -----
    If the number of faces is larger than one hundred (100),
    this function uses Scipy's `cKDTree` for limiting the search for neighbours
    to the immediate surroundings of any given face.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> vertices = [[0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 1.0, 0.0], [0.0, 1.0, 1.0]]
