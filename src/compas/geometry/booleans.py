    Parameters
    ----------
    A : tuple[sequence[point], sequence[[int, int, int]]]
        The vertices and faces of mesh A.
    B : tuple[sequence[point], sequence[[int, int, int]]]
        The vertices and faces of mesh B.

    -----
    This function is a "pluggable".
    This means that it doesn't provide an implementation, but receives an implementation from a corresponding "plugin".
    To use the plugin implementation, you have to install it in the same environment as COMPAS.
