## [0.6.2] 2019-04-30

### Added

### Changed

- Based mesh drawing for Rhino on RhinoCommon rather than Rhinoscriptsyntax.

### Removed


## [0.6.1] 2019-04-29

### Added

### Changed

### Removed


## [0.6.0] 2019-04-29

### Added

- Added `center` property getter to `compas.geometry.Cirle` primitive

- Added named colors to `compas.utilities.colors.py`.

### Changed

- Fix 'mesh_weld' and 'meshes_join_and_weld' against consecutive duplicates in face vertices.
- Fix setting of environment variables in `System.Diagnostics.Process`-based subprocess for `XFunc` and `RPC`.
- Fix `XFunc` on RhinoMac.
- Fix `trimesh_subdivide_loop` from `compas.datastructures`.
- Changed Numpy and Scipy version requirements to allow for Python 3.5.x.

### Removed

- Removed `mixing.py` from `compas.utilities`.
- Removed `singleton.py` from `compas.utilities`.
- Removed `xscript.py` from `compas.utilities`.
- Removed `sorting.py` from `compas.utilities`.
- Removed `names.py` from `compas.utilities`.
- Removed `xfunc.py` from `compas_rhino.utilities`, use `compas.utilities.XFunc` instead.
