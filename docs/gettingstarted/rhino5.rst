******************
Rhino 5 on Windows
******************

If you are using Rhino 5.0, you may also want to replace the version of IronPython
that comes with it, such that everything works properly.

To check your IronPython version in Rhino, go to the PythonScript Editor

.. code-block:: none

    Tools > PythonScript > Edit


.. figure:: /_images/rhino_scripteditor.*
     :figclass: figure
     :class: figure-img img-fluid


There, run the following snippet.

.. code-block:: python

    import sys
    print sys.version_info


This will display something like

.. code-block:: none

    sys.version_info(major=2, minor=7, micro=5, releaselevel='final', serial=0)


If the ``releaselevel`` is not ``'final'``,
install `IronPython 2.7.5 <https://github.com/IronLanguages/main/releases/tag/ipy-2.7.5>`__
and let Rhino know where it is by adding it to the Rhino Python Editor search paths.

.. note::

    Install `IronPython 2.7.5 <https://github.com/IronLanguages/main/releases/tag/ipy-2.7.5>`__,
    and not the latest version of IronPython.
    Rhino doesn't like it...


In the Rhino Python Editor, go to

::

    Tools > Options


And add

::

    C:\path\to\IronPython275
    C:\path\to\IronPython275\Lib
    C:\path\to\IronPython275\DLLs


.. note::

    Restart Rhino and check the version info as before.
