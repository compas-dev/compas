The core package of COMPAS (:mod:`compas`) defines all functionality for geometry processing,
data structures, topology, numerical methods, robotics, the plugin mechanism, remote procedure calls ...
and can be used independently of CAD systems in any environment that supports Python programming.

The CAD packages (:mod:`compas_rhino`, :mod:`compas_ghpython`, :mod:`compas_blender`)
provide a unified framework for reading and writing CAD geometry, for visualization
of COMPAS geometry and data structures, and for basic user inter interaction
in Blender, Rhino, and Grasshopper.

The package for 2D visualisation (:mod:`compas_plotters`)
simplifies "plotting" of COMPAS geometry objects and data structures.
